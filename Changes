    - Data is stored in YAML files, which you can put in (for example)
      Dropbox to sync to various machines
    - Provides four simple tools - whosthat, whoworkson, addwho and
      editwho, to manage your contact records.
    - team and project data is still manually added and edited. This
      could presumably be fixed at some point, but isn't a high priority
      for me.
    - Pushed everything out to Github. Patches welcome.
