# Who's That?

Barebones CRM for tracking people, projects, and AWS service teams.

With any luck, it will do more, eventually.

## Usage:

whosthat <name>

* Will list contact details for name, if found.
* Will list information, and a list of people, for a project or service,
  if found.

Eventually, will also allow adding/editing of these things, but for now,
we'll just manually edit .md files.

Ok, go.
